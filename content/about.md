    description: With respect to PR, I can offer an <span class="default-text bold-text">out of the box solution</span> to any number of organizations &#8212; large or small, in-house or external agency of record &#8212; in need of a <span class="default-text bold-text">knowledgeable resource</span>. In short, I am a well-traveled, but humble, all-weather hack that you can easily plug into <span class="default-text bold-text">your team's operation</span> on a per project basis or for ongoing support/assistance.

    description: While my skillset spans the full spectrum of the <span class="default-text bold-text">communications toolbox</span>, I've made a career out of applying a stringent and rigorous approach to the PR process focused on utilizing <span class="default-text bold-text">research and information gathering tactics</span> to help my clients more effectively communicate their business objectives. Hence the ardent interest in <span class="default-text bold-text">data science</span>...</p><br /><p>The word <span class="default-text bold-text">programmatically</span> gets my blood flowing. I'm an odd ball and I could care less. In the coming months, I plan on tackling a few projects that will combine some <span class="default-text bold-text">basic PR process oriented workflow habits</span> with <span class="default-text bold-text">data science</span>. First up&#58 developing a media list via a news API that will involve a saucy mix of some basic data munging, python and pandas. Stay tuned...</p><br /><p>In the meantime, below is a list of <span class="default-text bold-text">PR related services and skills</span> I am <span class="default-text bold-text">fluent</span> in, along with a fledgling list of <span class="default-text bold-text">data science focused tools</span> that I will be learning about and building up my <span class="default-text bold-text">competency</span> in over the next several months.</p>
